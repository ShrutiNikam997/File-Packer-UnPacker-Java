# File Packer and Unpacker – Java Project

File Packer and Unpacker is a Java-based command-line application that allows users to pack multiple files into a single file and later unpack them. The project demonstrates core Java concepts such as file handling, streams, and object-oriented design.

This project simulates a basic file archiving mechanism similar to compression tools, focusing on understanding low-level file operations.

## Features

- Pack multiple files into a single packed file
- Unpack files from the packed file to restore original data
- Uses file I/O streams for reading and writing data
- Handles files efficiently using Java concepts

## Tech Stack

- Language: Java
- Concepts Used:
  - File Handling
  - Streams (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream)
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Command Line Arguments

## How It Works

- Packing: Reads multiple input files and stores them sequentially into one packed file
- Unpacking: Extracts individual files from the packed file and recreates them

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java files
2. Run the packer to combine files into a single file
3. Run the unpacker to extract files from the packed file

## Learning Outcomes

- Strong understanding of Java file handling
- Working with byte streams
- Implementing real-world logic using Java
- Writing structured and maintainable Java code

## Future Enhancements

- Add encryption for packed files
- Improve error handling and validations
- Add compression logic
- Build a GUI-based version
